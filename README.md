## Credits and Inspiration

- The wallpaper is sourced from Omarchy's [official repository](https://github.com/basecamp/omarchy) under MIT License. It was what inspired the theme's name and aesthetic.
- The rich syntax highlighting is inspired by [sainnhe's Gruvbox Dark Hard Flat](https://github.com/sainnhe/gruvbox-material-vscode) which almost perfectly aligned with the aesthetic I was aiming for.
- The high contrast and matte black background is inspired by [tahayvr's matteblack.nvim](https://github.com/tahayvr/matteblack.nvim) theme for Neovim.
